# Emacs Commands Project

## Introduction

This directory is part of the `holbertonschool-zero_day` repository and focuses on basic Emacs commands. Each script demonstrates a specific Emacs operation, designed to help users understand and utilize Emacs more effectively as a text editor.

## Files and Descriptions

Each file in this directory corresponds to a different Emacs command, crafted as part of a learning exercise:
