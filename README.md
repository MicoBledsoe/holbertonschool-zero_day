# Holberton School Zero Day Repository

## Introduction

This repository represents the first major steps in my software development journey at Holberton School, now part of the Atlas program. It showcases foundational projects focusing on shell commands, Emacs, Vi, Git, and Bash scripting. The repository serves as a practical introduction to essential development tools and techniques.

## Why?

This collection of projects is designed to solidify the basics of command line operations, text editing, version control, and script writing. It is crucial for any developer to master these skills to build a strong foundation for more advanced software development.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All .c files comply with Betty coding and documentation style
- Maximum of one global variable
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All function prototypes are included in the header files
- All header files have include guards
- Usage of the standard library is permitted

## Compilation

Scripts and programs in this repository are designed to be run on a Linux environment with the appropriate permissions and environment settings.

###```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o [output_name]


### Part 5: How to Use
###```markdown
## How to Use

To run scripts or programs, navigate to the specific project directory, compile the files if necessary, and execute them directly from the command line.

Example:
###```bash
./script_name
